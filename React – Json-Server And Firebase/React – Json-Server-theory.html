Question 1: What do you mean by RESTful web services?

    RESTful web services follow the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture.

    They use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for communication.

    REST APIs exchange data mostly in JSON or XML format.

    They are stateless, meaning each request is independent.

    REST is widely used because it is lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate.


Question 2: What is Json-Server? How we use in React?

    JSON-Server is a tool to create a fake REST API quickly for testing.

    It reads data from a db.json file and serves it as an API.

    In React, we use it to mock backend APIs during development.

    Developers can run it with the command npx json-server --watch db.json.

    It helps practice fetching, posting, and updating data without a real backend


Question 3: How do you fetch data from a Json-server API in React? Explain fetch() or axios().

    In React, we fetch data using fetch() or axios() inside useEffect().

    fetch() is a built-in JavaScript method to make HTTP requests.

    Axios is an external library that simplifies API calls and error handling.

    Both return promises, which we handle using .then() or async/await.

    They allow us to get, send, or update data from the JSON-Server API.


Question 4: What is Firebase? What features does Firebase offer?

    Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) provided by Google.

    It offers Realtime Database and Firestore for storing data.

    Provides Authentication services like Email, Google, Facebook login.

    Supports Cloud Storage, Hosting, and Push Notifications.

    It is popular for building real-time, scalable web and mobile apps.

    
Question 5: Importance of handling errors and loading states when working with APIs in React.

    APIs may take time, so we show a loading state (spinner/message).

    Errors can occur due to network issues, so we display error messages.

    This improves user experience and prevents blank screens.

    Handling states makes the app more responsive and reliable.

    Good error/loading handling ensures better debugging and trust in the app.
