<!-- ===================JavaScript introductuion=====================

Question 1: What is JavaScript? Explain the role of JavaScript in web development.
    JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core    technologies of web development, along with HTML and CSS.

    Role of JavaScript in Web Development:
    Client-side scripting: JavaScript runs in the browser and can manipulate the content of web pages dynamically without reloading the page.

    Interactivity: JavaScript enables features like image sliders, form validation, modals, dropdowns, animations, and more.

    DOM Manipulation: It can access and modify the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to change the structure, style, and c   ontent of a web page.

    Event Handling: JavaScript responds to user actions such as clicks, keyboard input, or mouse movements.

    Backend Development: With the help of Node.js, JavaScript is also used on the server-side to build scalable network applications.


Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?
    JavaScript is mainly used for web development to create interactive web pages, while Python and Java are general-purpose languages.  JavaScript runs in the browser or on servers using Node.js, whereas Python and Java typically run on interpreters or the Java     Virtual Machine (JVM). JavaScript is dynamically typed and has a lightweight syntax, while Java is statically typed and more verbose. Python is   known for its simplicity and is widely used in data science and automation. Unlike Java and Python, JavaScript is essential for front-end development in web applications.


Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?
    The <script> tag in HTML is used to add JavaScript code to a web page. It can contain inline JavaScript code or link to an external .js     file. To link an external file, you use the src attribute like this: <script src="script.js"></script>. This tag is usually placed at   the end of the <body> to ensure the HTML is loaded before the script runs. Using external files keeps the code clean, organized, and  reusable.


=======================variable and data type=======================


Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const?
    Variables in JavaScript are containers used to store data values. They allow developers to reuse and manipulate data in a program.

    Variable Declaration:
    var – Function-scoped. Can be updated and re-declared.

    let – Block-scoped. Can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.

    const – Block-scoped. Cannot be updated or re-declared


Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each.
    JavaScript supports two main types of data: primitive and non-primitive.
    Primitive data types include:

    String (e.g., "Hello"),

    Number (e.g., 42),

    Boolean (e.g., true or false),

    Undefined (a declared variable without a value),

    Null (a variable with no value),

    Symbol and BigInt (for unique and large values).

    Non-primitive data types include:

    Objects, Arrays, and Functions, which are collections or structures used to store multiple values or logic.


Question 3: What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?
    In JavaScript, undefined and null both represent "no value", but in different ways.

    undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value yet.

    null is an intentional assignment that means the variable has no value.
    JavaScript automatically assigns undefined to uninitialized variables, while null must be assigned by the programmer.
    So, undefined is system-defined, and null is developer-defined.



=======================JavaScript operators=============================

Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.
    In JavaScript, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. The main types include:

    Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like +, -, *, /, and %.

    Assignment operators are used to assign values, such as =, +=, -=, etc.

    C  omparison operators compare two values, such as ==, ===, !=, >, <.

    Logical operators are used for combining conditions, such as && (AND), || (OR), and ! (NOT).


Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
    In JavaScript, == is known as the loose equality operator, while === is called the strict equality operator.

    == compares two values after converting their types if they are different.

    === compares both the value and the data type, without any type conversion.
    For example, 5 == "5" returns true, but 5 === "5" returns false.
    Using === is recommended for accurate comparisons.



=========================control flow=============================


Question 1: What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work with an example.
    Control flow in JavaScript is the order in which individual statements, functions, or instructions are executed. It helps in making decisions and executing code conditionally.
    The if-else statement is used to run one block of code if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.
    This helps in handling different cases and logic in a program.
    For example, checking if a person is eligible to vote based on age using if-else.


Question 2: Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a switch statement instead of if-else?
    A switch statement is used to execute one block of code out of many options based on the value of a variable or expression.
    Each case in a switch block represents a possible value. If a match is found, that block runs. The default case runs if no match is    found.
    Switch statements are best used when checking one variable against multiple values.
    They make the code cleaner and easier to read than multiple if-else-if statements.



=========================loops========================


Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while).
    In JavaScript, loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop repeats code a specific number of times based on counter. The while loop continues to execute as long as a given condition is true, checking the condition before each iteration. The do-while loop executes the code block once first and then repeats it while the condition remains true. Loops help automate repetitive  tasks and control program flow.

Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
    The main difference is in when the condition is checked. A while loop checks the condition before executing the code block, so if the condition is false initially, the code may never run. A do-while loop runs the code block once before checking the condition, ensuring the code executes at least one time regardless of the condition.

===================function=======================


Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.
    Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help organize code and avoid repetition by    grouping related instructions. A function is declared by specifying its name and the actions it will perform inside curly braces. To   execute the function’s code, it must be called by its name


Question 2: What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
    A function declaration defines a named function using the function keyword, and it is hoisted, meaning it can be called before its  definition in the code. A function expression involves assigning an anonymous or named function to a variable. Function expressions are  not hoisted, so they can only be used after they are defined. Both ways create functions but differ in syntax and behavior regarding     hoisting.


Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
    Parameters are variables listed in a function’s definition used to receive input values when the function is called. They allow the     function to work with different data. A function can process these inputs and produce a return value, which is the result the function  outputs back to the part of the program that called it. Return values enable functions to provide useful results and be integrated into  larger computations.

======================arrays======================


Question 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array?
    An array in JavaScript is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. These values are stored in an ordered    list and can be accessed using their index positions, starting from zero. Arrays allow you to group related data and work with     collections efficiently. You declare and initialize an array by specifying the values inside square brackets.

Question 2: Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays.
    The methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() are commonly used to add or remove elements from arrays.

    push() adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

    pop() removes the last element from the end of an array.

    shift() removes the first element from the beginning of an array.

    unshift() adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
    These methods help manage the contents of an array by modifying its size and elements.



====================object============================


Question 1: What is an object in JavaScript? How are objects different from arrays?
    An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key (called a property) maps to a value. Objects are used to     represent real-world entities with related data and behaviors. Unlike arrays, which store ordered lists of values accessed by numeric   indexes, objects store unordered data accessed by named keys. Objects are ideal for representing complex data with named attributes.



Question 2: Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and bracket notation.
    Object properties can be accessed or updated using dot notation or bracket notation.

    Dot notation uses a dot followed by the property name (e.g., object.property) and is simple and easy to read.

    Bracket notation uses square brackets with the property name as a string (e.g., object["property"]), which is useful when property names    contain spaces, special characters, or are stored in variables. Both methods allow reading and modifying the values of object properties.



=======================events==========================

Question 1: What are JavaScript events? Explain the role of event listeners.
    JavaScript events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicks, key presses, mouse movements, or page loading.     They allow web pages to respond dynamically to user interactions. Event listeners are functions or pieces of code that wait for specific    events to occur and then execute in response. They enable developers to create interactive and responsive web applications by handling     user actions.


Question 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in JavaScript?
    The addEventListener() method attaches an event listener to a specified element, allowing it to listen for a particular event type (like    a click or key press). When the event occurs, the associated function is executed. This method is preferred because it lets you add    multiple listeners for the same event on one element without overwriting existing listeners, making event handling flexible and modular.

example :   button.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("Button was clicked!");
    }); 

    
================Dom===================

Question 1: What is the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript? How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?

    The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects, where each node is an object representing a part of the document (such as elements, attributes, or text).

    The DOM allows JavaScript to access, manipulate, and modify the content, structure, and styles of a webpage dynamically.

    For example, JavaScript can:

    Change text content of elements

    Add or remove HTML elements

    Modify styles (CSS)

    Handle user events like clicks or form submissions

Questoin 2:  Explain the methods getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and querySelector() used to select elements from the DOM.
        1: getElementById()
    
            Description: Selects a single element with the specified ID.
            Returns: A single element object or null if not found.

        2: getElementsByClassName()

            Description: Selects all elements with the specified class name.
            Returns: An HTMLCollection (array-like object) of matching elements.

        3: querySelector()
            
            Description: Returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
            Returns: A single element object or null if not found.


==============timing events===============


 Question 1: Explain the setTimeout() and setInterval() functions in JavaScript. How are they used for timing events?

        1. setTimeout()
                The setTimeout() function executes a function once after a specified delay (in milliseconds).
                It is used to delay a certain action.

        2. setInterval()
                The setInterval() function repeats the execution of a function continuously at a fixed time interval (in milliseconds).
                It is used to perform repeating tasks, like timers, clocks, or animations.


 Question 2: Provide an example of how to use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2 seconds.

        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("Delayed by 2 seconds!");
        }, 2000);



====================error handaling====================

 Question 1: What is error handling in JavaScript? Explain the try, catch, and finally blocks with an example.
        What is Error Handling?
            Error handling in JavaScript refers to the process of managing runtime errors — errors that occur while the code is running. Instead of crashing the entire application when an error occurs, JavaScript provides tools like try, catch, and finally to handle such errors gracefully.

        try {
            let a = 10;
            let b = a + x; // x is not defined — causes ReferenceError
            console.log(b);
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("An error occurred: " + error.message);
        } finally {
            console.log("This block always runs.");
        }
        
        
question 2: Why is error handling important in JavaScript applications?

        Prevents Application Crash:
            Without error handling, one runtime error can crash the entire script.

        Improves User Experience:
            Users see friendly error messages instead of broken interfaces or blank pages.

        Debugging Support:
            catch blocks can log meaningful error details that help developers identify and fix bugs.

        Maintains Flow:
            With proper handling, other parts of the application continue working even if one part fails.

        Handles Unexpected Scenarios:
                External data, user inputs, or network responses may not always be predictable. Error handling ensures those cases are covered.
