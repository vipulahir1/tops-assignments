Question 1: What is React Router? How does it handle routing in single-page applications?
     Router is a library used in React for handling navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). Instead of reloading the whole page, it updates the URL and renders components dynamically, making the app feel faster. It manages routing using the browser’s history API.


Question 2: Explain the difference between BrowserRouter, Route, Link, and Switch components in React Router.
    BrowserRouter: Wraps the app and enables routing using the browser’s history API.

    Route: Defines which component should render based on the URL path.

    Link: Used to navigate between routes without reloading the page.

    Switch: Renders only the first matching route among multiple <Route> components. -->
