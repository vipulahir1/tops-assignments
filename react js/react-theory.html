Question 1: What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and libraries?
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).

Difference from others:

React focuses on UI only, not full application structure like Angular.

Uses a virtual DOM for better performance.

Uses a component-based approach (UI = collection of reusable components).

React uses JSX, a mix of HTML and JavaScript.



Question 2: Core Principles of React
Virtual DOM:
React creates a virtual copy of the real DOM. When changes happen, React updates only the changed part, making it fast and efficient.

Component-Based Architecture:
The UI is broken into reusable components (like header, button, etc.), each with its own logic and design. It makes code organized, reusable, and easy to manage.




Question 3: Advantages of Using React.js in Web Development
Fast Performance (thanks to virtual DOM)

Reusable Components = Less code, better structure

One-Way Data Flow = More control and debugging

Huge Community Support and tools

SEO Friendly

Easy to integrate with other frameworks/libraries

Question 1: What is JSX in React.js? Why is it used?
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.
It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.

Why used?

Makes the UI code more readable and easier to write.

Helps you mix HTML with JavaScript logic in a single place (components).

It looks like HTML but compiles into regular JavaScript using React.createElement().





Question 2: How is JSX different from regular JavaScript? Can you write JavaScript inside JSX?
Differences:

JSX allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript.

Regular JavaScript doesn’t allow HTML tags inside it.

Yes, you can write JavaScript inside JSX using curly braces {}.



Question 3: Importance of Using Curly Braces {} in JSX Expressions
Curly braces {} let you embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX.

You can use variables, functions, conditionals (ternary), or any JS logic inside them.
